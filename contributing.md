## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing
changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

This tool is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from
anyone using it. There are many ways to contribute, including improving the
documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code
which can be incorporated into this tool itself.

If you encounter bugs, or need support with the tool, please use the issue 
tracker to submit a new issue.

Finally, this tool is aimed at WPEngine users. While we welcome contributions,
it is outside of the scope of this tool to expand the range of redirects that 
this tool can generate, and is mainly for generating mass redirect `.txt` files
for WPEngine.

## Basic Rules

Your Responsibilities:

  - Make sure you write any unit tests for any new code added
  - If your changes are major, they should first be discussed in an issue
  - Keep feature versions as small as possible. Ideally, split up features into separate versions

## Code Formatting

  - 4 space tabs
  - Choose object oriented vs functional in most situations
  - Each object lives in their own file, named the same as the object. So, `Foobar` becomes `Foobar.js`
  - Do not commit/include editor specific files (ex: `.vscode/`)
  - Use valid JSDoc 3 docblocks

## Getting Started

Your development cycle should look something like:

  - Create a fork of this repository
  - Make the changes you intend to make
  - Create and unit test those changes using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
  - If you haven't already, add valid docblocks to all new code, and update previous docblocks
  - Submit a PR from your fork to our repository

And thanks again for contributing!
